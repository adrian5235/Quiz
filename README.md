This is a Quiz app that works on android, currently only available in polish language.
You can run a quiz of 5 questions, each has 1 correct and 3 wrong answers.
After you correctly translate the specific word / sentence 3 times in a row, it's considered "learned" and will no longer appear as a question.
You can check your "learned" and "unlearned" in the statistics tab, where you can also reset progression.
